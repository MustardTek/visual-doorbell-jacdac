# Visual Doorbell
This device aims to assist those in the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community by giving them a visual notification that someone is at the door. Users can choose to use the doorbell with either a desk lamp or a smaller LED light. 

When a delivery person or visitor presses the doorbell, the lamp or LED inside will flash white light. The desk lamp also functions as a normal lamp, with a slider to control the brightness and turn the lamp off, as well as a rotary knob to change the color of the light. The LED will only flash when the doorbell is pressed, until the user pushes the button to turn it off.

## How to Obtain a Visual Doorbell

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build the Visual Doorbell are contained within this repository. 


## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Assembly Guide and confirm customization options with user
Read through the Assembly Guide to get an overview of the process of making the Visual Doorbell. Confirm with the user if they would like to use the doorbell with the desk lamp or with the LED.

### 2. Reference the Bill of Materials to obtain necessary parts and tools
 - [Visual Doorbell BOM](https://github.com/MustardTek/visual-doorbell-jacdac/blob/main/Documentation/Visual%20Doorbell%20BOM.xlsx)

### 3. Print the 3D Printable components

3D print files can be found in the [3D Print Files](https://github.com/MustardTek/visual-doorbell-jacdac/tree/main/3D%20Print%20Files) folder. Photos of 3D printed parts can be found in the [Photos](https://github.com/MustardTek/visual-doorbell-jacdac/tree/main/Photos) folder.

### 4. Assemble the Visual Doorbell

Reference the Assembly guide to assemble the components and import the code for the Visual Doorbell.

### 5. Test the Visual Doorbell
Connect the doorbell and lamp/LED to power in your home and test to see if the light flashes when the doorbell is presseed.
