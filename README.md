# Visual Doorbell
This device aims to assist those in the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community by giving them a visual notification that someone is at the door. Users can choose to use the doorbell with either a desk lamp or a smaller LED light. 

When a delivery person or visitor presses the doorbell, the lamp or LED inside will flash white light. The desk lamp also functions as a normal lamp, with a slider to control the brightness and turn the lamp off, as well as a rotary knob to change the color of the light. The LED will only flash when the doorbell is pressed, until the user pushes the button to turn it off.
